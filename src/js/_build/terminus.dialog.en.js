Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, \nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the \ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A \nWATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, \nAlice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had \nnever before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch \nto take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the \nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down \na large rabbit-hole under the hedge. \n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how \nin the world she was to get out again. \n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then \ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think \nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\n\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had \nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what \nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what \nshe was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at \nthe sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and \nbook-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She \ntook down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled \n'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did \nnot like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it \ninto one of the cupboards as she fell past it. \n\n'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall \nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me \nat home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the \ntop of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)\n\nDown, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder how \nmany miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting \nsomewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four \nthousand miles down, I think—' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several \nthings of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this \nwas not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as \nthere was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it \nover) '—yes, that's about the right distance—but then I wonder what \nLatitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, \nor Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\n\nPresently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the \nearth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with \ntheir heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—' (she was rather glad \nthere WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the \nright word) '—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, \nyou know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she \ntried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling through \nthe air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an ignorant little \ngirl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I \nshall see it written up somewhere.' \n\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began \ntalking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!' \n(Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at \ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are \nno mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's \nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here \nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a \ndreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, \n'Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, \nit didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was \ndozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand \nin hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, \ntell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! \nthump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the \nfall was over.\n\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: \nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another \nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down \nit. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, \nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my \nears and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it \nwhen she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: \nshe found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row \nof lamps hanging from the roof. \n\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; \nand when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, \ntrying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how \nshe was ever to get out again.\n\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of \nsolid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and \nAlice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors \nof the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the \nkey was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. \nHowever, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she \nhad not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen \ninches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her \ngreat delight it fitted! \n\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not \nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the \npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to \nget out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright \nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head \nthrough the doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought \npoor Alice, 'it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, \nhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I \nonly know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things \nhad happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few \nthings indeed were really impossible. \n\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went \nback to the table, half hoping she might find password=IHTFP another key on it, or at \nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this \ntime she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here \nbefore,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper \nlabel, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large \nletters.\n\nIt was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was \nnot going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, \n'and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not'; for she had read \nseveral nice little histories about children who had got burnt, \nand eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because \nthey WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught \nthem: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it \ntoo long; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, \nit usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink \nmuch from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is almost certain to \ndisagree with you, sooner or later. \n\nHowever, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to \ntaste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed \nflavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, \nand hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.","room_paradise":"Paradise","room_paradise_text":"You have truly found Paradise with the sudo password. \nCongratulations.","room_paradise_ls":"There's really nothing interesting in Paradise.","room_trollcave":"CaveOfDisgruntledTrolls","room_trollcave_text":"The cave is dark and smells like... feet?
